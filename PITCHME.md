## Getting Ready for Class

While you are waiting for class to begin, please take a few minutes to set up your local work environment.

**Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub.com Account**

For this class, we will use a public account on **GitHub.com**. We do this for a few reasons:

* We don't want you to "practice" in repositories that contain real code.
* We are going to break some things so we can teach you how to fix them. (therefore, refer to the bullet above)
If you already have a github.com account you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can set up your free account by following these steps:

1. Access GitHub.com and click Sign up.
2. Choose the free account.
3. You will receive a verification email at the address provided.
4. Click the link to complete the verification process.
